Predicting CO2 emissions for a car from its Engine size.

Testing the accuracy in predicting CO2 emissions vs Engine size using polynomial regression of degree 3. The polynomial equation is changed to linear equation using fit_transform. fit_transform takes our x values, and output a list of our data raised from power of 0 to power of d(degree=d).
Thus, polynomial regression can now be considered as multiple linear regression.Then the parameters are found which best fit the curvy line.
