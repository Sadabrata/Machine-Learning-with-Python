Using K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to predict a customer class.

A telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into K groups. If demographic data can be used to predict group membership, the company can customize offers for individual prospective customers. Thus it is a classification problem and K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm is used to predict the customer class.
