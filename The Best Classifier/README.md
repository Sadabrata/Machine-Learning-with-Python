# The-Best-Classifier
A classifier is built to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

KNN, DecisionTree, SVM and LogisticRegression models are created on a historical dataset of previous loan applications, and the accuracy results of all these models are compared to find the best classification algo for this specific task.
